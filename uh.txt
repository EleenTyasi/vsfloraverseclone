uh hey. 
can you read this?
yeah, you probably can.
whoever's hearing this, this is bonnie!
i hope you enjoy the musical performances 
there's stuff hidden in the folders of the mod, some aren't so easy to find
some are
Very Much Not:tm:

shoutouts to all the critters that helped to compose the show you see
something tells me that despite beleth's performance being recorded that i may want to do my old performance over again
yeah, i might do that, it sounds a little rough, and i've gotten more practice with things like that

some things didn't go quite as planned, the puppets that beleth had got stagefright; so they're just watching
we're still waiting on h.h to decide on their songs; but from what i've heard in rehearsal, i think they'll be worth the wait
they're tall, so i gotta adjust for that on my stage

that boyfriend fella is fun, but each time i look at him i get a weird feeling of deja vu?
idk

well, nevermind that. 
we put a lot of love into the performance you see now on the stage
and hope you're just as hyped as we are

oh. i just remembered something

you might want to take a look at the surfnet, heard there's a good webcomic somewhere

ps: when you launch the recording software, you might see something that ain't meant to be there. someone's trying to fix that bug
