okay so, i'm just gonna ask

if you do want to use any of the assets from vs. floraverse
i gotta ask for a few things:

1. Please credit me for the charting. Eleen or AetheriaBunny; I ain't picky.
2. If you're gonna use a character that isn't Bonnie, please credit Floraverse and the animator. 
3. If you're gonna use Bonnie, please credit myself, as well as the animator for her opponent model.
4. If you use content from Vs. Floraverse in Roblox; either on Funky Friday or on Friday Night Bloxxin', All I'm gonna say is please credit the names in the credits doc.
5. Floraverse is Share Alike Creative Commons. This mod, is also Share Alike CC; meaning that anyone can pretty much use it's stuff for free.
6. Please consider checking out the source material - it's really good.
