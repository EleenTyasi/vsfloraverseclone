# Vs.FloraversePsychEngine
this is just my first ever fnf mod.
as such, i'm only having this repo bc the Funkin' team politely asks for the code to be open source
i cannot program worth beans. i'm using github primarily to track how much progress i've made on this mod
holy shit
i actually made edits to the source code to actually make it look a little more professional

# psych engine
https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine <- 

y'all made this shit so easy for me to get started, and to learn how to use
thank y'all

# mechanics guide
so, here's something to know
easy will never have mechanics; it's meant to still provide a challenge yet not to the point of frustration
medium and hard is the dev intended difficulty

beating a week is considered beating any difficulty, including easy

do not be ashamed if you have to play this mod on easy! i'm not afraid to admit that i have trouble with it

so, week 1's week, otherwise known as Week Bon

# Week Bonnie - Mechanic: Hurt Notes
this is an easy one to explain. hurt notes deal damage to you. avoid tapping on black and red notes (will change in future)
on normal, hurt notes appear part way on song 2, and will appear on song 3 all the time
on hard, all songs will have hurt notes

# Week Hothead - Mechanic: Overheat
overheat is this week's mechanic, where your HP will drain on medium and hard
overheat is not lethal, and should not be lethal
as long as you're still fine, this should be an easy song to deal with, but on hard, the drain is a lot more punishing, so be careful of that

# Week ??? - Mechanic: TBD
this one is a secret
