# Vs.FloraversePsychEngine
this is just my first ever fnf mod.
as such, i'm only having this repo bc the Funkin' team politely asks for the code to be open source
i cannot program worth beans. i'm using github primarily to track how much progress i've made on this mod
holy shit
i actually made edits to the source code to actually make it look a little more professional
