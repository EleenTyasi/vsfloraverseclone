# Vs.FloraversePsychEngine
this is just my first ever fnf mod.
as such, i'm only having this repo bc the Funkin' team politely asks for the code to be open source
i cannot program worth beans. i'm using github primarily to track how much progress i've made on this mod
holy shit
i actually made edits to the source code to actually make it look a little more professional

# i wanna play it!
cool! just know that it's not finished, so until the first week is done, there is no public release; though you can download it via downloading the code.
there's no need to compile it, should be just a simple download.


# psych engine
-> https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine <- 

y'all made this shit so easy for me to get started, and to learn how to use
thank y'all

# so what exactly is this?
it's a preview of the Vs. Floraverse mod; and as my first mod, i'm making it with a bunch of love
though the first week is my character; the rest of the mod will eventually be characters from the webcomic 

# what the heck is a floraverse
www.floraverse.com
it's a neat webcomic ig lol

# mechanics guide
so, here's something to know
easy will have very little mechanics; it's meant to still provide a challenge yet not to the point of frustration
medium and hard is the dev intended difficulty however. no content is locked behind a difficulty gate however

beating a week is considered beating any difficulty, including easy

do not be ashamed if you have to play this mod on easy! i'm not afraid to admit that i have trouble with it

so, week 1's week, otherwise known as Week Bon

# Week Bonnie - Mechanic: Pressure and Crystal Notes
Pressure starts to build near the end of song two of Week Bonnie. Pressure drains BF's HP when Bonnie sings. Hitting notes may help you to endure her pressure.
Crystal Notes are mines that must be avoided. They hurt, and if you ain't careful, they'll KO you. 

# Week Beleth - Mechanic: Puppet Notes
Puppet Notes MUST BE HIT! They WILL KO you on hard, and deal catastrophic damage if you miss them on medium! 
Fun Fact: The arrows match each one of Beleth's puppets, as well as themself. Hold notes are meant to have the look of Beleth's wand.
Puppet notes only appear on Hard and Medium. 
Crystal notes appear instead on easy. 

# Week Hothead - Mechanic: Overheat
Overheat, due to the presence of a HOTHEAD type angel is a status effect. As you play the song, the aura coming from this angel singes your healthbar. 
This singe, deals gradual HP drain while BF sings. On all difficulties however, Overheat cannot be lethal. It won't lower you beyond a quarter of your HP. 
On hard, the drain is intense, because the angel's rage is like an eternal flame, baby. 
On normal, the drain is fast, but managable, because he's mad, but not too mad.
On easy, the drain is akin to Pressure. He's not mad, just grumpy.
