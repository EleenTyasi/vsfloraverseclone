# Vs.FloraversePsychEngine
this is just my first ever fnf mod.
as such, i'm only having this repo bc the Funkin' team politely asks for the code to be open source
i cannot program worth beans. i'm using github primarily to track how much progress i've made on this mod
holy shit
i actually made edits to the source code to actually make it look a little more professional

# chromatics pls?
-> https://github.com/EleenTyasi/VsFloraverseChromatics <-

# i wanna play it!

# psych engine
-> https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine <- 

y'all made this shit so easy for me to get started, and to learn how to use
thank y'all

# so what exactly is this?
it's a preview of the Vs. Floraverse mod; and as my first mod, i'm making it with a bunch of love
though the first week is my character; the rest of the mod will eventually be characters from the webcomic 

# what the heck is a floraverse
www.floraverse.com
it's a neat webcomic ig lol

# how nuts will this be eleen

probably not as crazy as the other FNF mods
but i'm putting as much effort as i can into this mod
